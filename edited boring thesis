\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis investigates how periodic rippling in two-dimensional (2D) group-VI transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers---such as MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}, MoSe\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2}---can induce flat electronic bands under uniaxial compression. Through first-principles simulations, we trace the formation of periodic ripples and show that, beyond a certain compression, flat valence bands emerge in these otherwise semiconducting TMDs.\ In particular, a mechanical-electronic transition unfolds:\ initial deformation leads to buckling, which triggers the formation of ripples---much like a thin sheet forced to bend under pressure.\ This symmetry breaking reshapes the electronic structure: as compression increases, the $\Gamma$-point (hosting a nearly flat segment along the $\overline{\Gamma X}$ direction) rises in energy, while the K-point (initially the valence band maximum) drops. At a critical compression, these levels cross---ushering the birth of a flat valence band and a fundamental shift in the material’s properties.\ The resulting system forms a built-in lateral heterostructure---entirely within a chemically uniform monolayer---achieved without stacking, twisting, or chemical doping.\ Curvature acts as the driving parameter, and the outcome is striking:\ heavy-hole states are pinned in high-curvature regions, while electrons remain free to move.\ This electronic asymmetry opens pathways for exciton trapping, anisotropic hole transport, and exploration of correlated electronic phases in 2D systems.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background and Motivation}

Two-dimensional (2D) materials, held together by van der Waals (vdW) interactions, offer an extraordinary playground for exploring quantum phenomena at the atomic scale~\cite{gish2024van}. Among the most striking discoveries in this field is the realization that careful structural manipulation can profoundly alter the electronic properties of these materials.

A prime example is the phenomenon of flat electronic bands in moiré-patterned bilayer graphene. When two graphene sheets are stacked with a slight twist near a so-called ``magic angle'' ($\sim1.1^\circ$), the resulting long-wavelength moiré superlattice dramatically reshapes the band structure~\cite{bistritzer2011moire}. The overlapping periodic potentials from the two layers cause electrons to localize, effectively flattening the bands near the Fermi level. In these flat bands, the kinetic energy of carriers is suppressed, enhancing electron-electron interactions and giving rise to a remarkable array of correlated phenomena: unconventional superconductivity~\cite{po2018origin, cao2018unconventional, isobe2018unconventional, wu2018theory, lian2019twisted, chou2019superconductor, codecido2019correlated, yankowitz2019tuning, saito2020independent, shavit2021theory, oh2021evidence}, magnetism~\cite{gonzalez2017electrically, sboychakov2018externally, sharpe2019emergent, wolf2019electrically, li2020experimental, pons2020flat, klebl2021importance, vahedi2021magnetism}, strange metal behavior~\cite{polshyn2019large, wu2019phonon, cao2020strange}, intrinsic quantized anomalous Hall effects~\cite{serlin2020intrinsic, bultinck2020mechanism, liu2021theories}, and correlated insulating states~\cite{cao2018correlated, po2018origin, yuan2018model, padhi2018doped, ochi2018possible, zhang2020correlated, nuckolls2020strongly, da2021correlation, liu2021tuning, pierce2021unconventional}.

Direct experimental visualization of flat bands~\cite{utama2021visualization} has confirmed their central role, firmly establishing twisted bilayer graphene as the flagship system of the emerging field of ``twistronics''~\cite{ciarrocchi2022excitonic}.

\section{Limitations of Twistronics}

While moiré flat bands have opened up exciting new territory, twistronics comes with inherent challenges. The realization of flat bands critically depends on achieving extremely precise interlayer twist angles, with tolerances often less than $0.1^\circ$~\cite{bistritzer2011moire}. Small deviations can significantly alter or even destroy the correlated electronic phases. Moreover, the fabrication of twisted bilayers at controlled angles remains nontrivial, limiting scalability and reproducibility.

This sensitivity naturally raises an intriguing question: could one access flat-band physics without relying on meticulous stacking or twist-angle engineering? Could there exist a more robust and mechanically accessible route?

\section{Strain-Engineered Flat Bands: A New Pathway}

This thesis explores an alternative strategy: creating flat bands through mechanical deformation rather than stacking. Specifically, we propose that applying controlled uniaxial compression to a monolayer 2D material can induce periodic rippling, break the original crystal symmetry, and generate spatially modulated electronic landscapes that mimic lateral heterostructures.

The key insight motivating this work is the strong strain dependence of the band gap in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers~\cite{Trainer2019}. Just as tuning the tension of a guitar string changes its pitch, applying strain or bending can alter the band structure of TMDs. Spatial variations in strain or curvature can thus create built-in lateral heterostructures without requiring chemical patterning, multilayer stacking, or external fields.

Using density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we systematically investigate the emergence of flat valence bands and localized hole states in periodically rippled group-VI TMDs---specifically MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}, MoSe\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2}. Our calculations reveal that moderate compressive strains, inducing sinusoidal rippling along the armchair direction, can drive a mechanical-electronic transition: initial uniform compression leads to buckling, which breaks the threefold symmetry of the lattice, modifies the electronic dispersion, and ultimately flattens the valence band near the Fermi level.

In particular, we observe that as compression increases, the energy of the $\Gamma$-point rises relative to the $\mathrm{K}$-point, eventually triggering a direct-to-indirect band gap transition. At a critical compression, these levels cross---signaling the sudden birth of a flat valence band and a fundamental reshaping of the material’s electronic properties. The resulting structure behaves as a lateral heterostructure defined by curvature rather than chemistry, with holes strongly localized in regions of high curvature (the ripple peaks and valleys), while conduction electrons remain delocalized across the sheet.

\section{Research Focus and Objectives}

The objectives of this thesis are threefold:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mechanics}: Characterize the onset of rippling and the resulting geometric modulation under applied uniaxial compression in TMD monolayers.
    \item \textbf{Electronic Structure}: Analyze the evolution of the band structure as a function of compression and curvature, including the emergence of flat bands and anisotropic carrier effective masses.
    \item \textbf{Localization Phenomena}: Demonstrate the formation of strain-induced lateral heterostructures and localized hole states, and assess their robustness across different TMD materials.
\end{itemize}

By achieving these goals, we aim to establish periodic mechanical deformation as a new and versatile tool for engineering electronic landscapes in 2D materials, expanding the available pathways beyond stacking and twistronics.

\section{Significance and Outlook}

The ability to induce flat bands through mechanical compression alone offers significant advantages: it eliminates the need for twist-angle precision, allows dynamic tunability via strain, and opens the door to new types of devices based on strain-defined quantum wells and anisotropic transport channels.

Moreover, the spontaneous emergence of lateral heterostructures within a chemically uniform monolayer hints at new possibilities for exciton funneling, strain-tunable optoelectronics, and the exploration of correlated phases in an atomically thin platform.

In short, while our colleagues in twistronics have demonstrated the power of precision geometric engineering, we propose that sometimes, simply giving a 2D material a well-calibrated squeeze can unlock equally profound physics---turning ripples into quantum playgrounds.

\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{Emergence of Flat Bands in Twisted 2D Materials}

Following the discovery of moiré flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene~\cite{bistritzer2011moire}, the search for flat electronic bands has extended to a broad class of van der Waals (vdW) materials. Researchers quickly realized that similar flat-band phenomena could arise in a variety of 2D systems, including $\gamma$-graphyne, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)~\cite{an2021emergence, zhao2020formation, naik2018ultraflatbands, wu2018hubbard, wu2019topological, ruiz2019interlayer, zhan2020tunability}.

While twisted bilayer graphene exhibits an exceptional ``magic angle'' near $1.1^\circ$ that optimizes band flattening, not all materials require such fine-tuning. In systems like h-BN and some TMDs, flat bands emerge once the twist angle is sufficiently small, without the need for a specific critical value. Instead, these systems exhibit a more continuous crossover into the flat-band regime, where the bandwidth becomes comparable to electron-electron interaction energies. In these materials, rather than chasing a sharp resonance condition, one merely needs to achieve a sufficiently long moiré wavelength---patience, rather than precision, unlocks the physics.

\section{Flat Bands in TMD Moiré Systems}

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have proven to be particularly fertile ground for flat-band exploration. Twisted bilayers of WSe\textsubscript{2} and MoSe\textsubscript{2}, for instance, exhibit correlated insulating states and signatures of superconductivity at moderate twist angles ($\sim4^\circ$--$5^\circ$)~\cite{wang2020correlated}. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy studies reveal localized electronic states and energy modulations in WSe\textsubscript{2}/WS\textsubscript{2} heterostructures that depend sensitively on the twist angle~\cite{li2021imaging}. 

Beyond insulating behavior, flat-band plasmons have been observed in twisted MoS\textsubscript{2} systems~\cite{kuang2022flat}, and theoretical studies have emphasized the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in shaping the electronic structure of TMD heterobilayers~\cite{rademaker2022spin}. Collectively, these studies underscore the remarkable tunability of TMD moiré systems and their ability to host exotic electronic phases reminiscent of their graphene counterparts.

However, nearly all prior efforts in TMD-based flat-band research have focused on stacking and twisting as the primary control knobs. While stacking two monolayers offers new degrees of freedom, it also introduces fabrication complexity, interlayer disorder, and limitations on scalability. Moreover, achieving uniform twist angles across large samples remains a major experimental hurdle.

\section{Strain and Buckling in 2D Materials: A Different Perspective}

In parallel with these developments, researchers have also explored the mechanical properties of 2D materials, including their response to strain and their propensity for buckling under compression~\cite{dai2019strain, qi2023recent, li_buckling_2021, han_buckling_2021, li_molecular_2019}. For monolayers such as MoS\textsubscript{2}, graphene, and h-BN, even moderate compressive stresses can induce spontaneous out-of-plane deformation---ripples, wrinkles, and periodic buckles.

While much of the early focus centered on understanding mechanical stability and elasticity, it became increasingly clear that mechanical deformation could also modulate electronic properties. Shi et al.~\cite{shi_flexoelectricity_2018} demonstrated that bending a MoSe\textsubscript{2} monolayer induces flexoelectric effects, generating local dipoles purely from curvature. Qi et al.~\cite{qi_bandgap_2013} predicted that strain gradients could engineer band gaps in MoS\textsubscript{2} ribbons by combining bending with external electric fields. In their study, curvature-induced dipoles caused a direct-to-indirect gap transition when ripples were aligned along the zigzag direction (although no such transition was observed for armchair rippling in their calculations).

These early hints suggested that mechanical deformation could serve as a powerful, underexplored lever for band structure engineering. However, a systematic exploration of whether periodic mechanical deformation could generate flat bands---analogous to moiré superlattices---remained largely absent.

\section{Curvature-Engineered Electronic Structures: Recent Developments}

More recently, interest in curvature-engineered band structures has grown. Xu et al.~\cite{xu2021moire} and Pasquale et al.~\cite{pasquale2023electrical} explored how strain superlattices and substrate-induced modulations could mimic moiré physics without needing stacking or twisting. Their findings hint that built-in strain or bending fields could localize carriers, modulate effective masses, and create emergent minibands.

Lee et al.~\cite{lee_strain-induced_2023} demonstrated that strain could induce dark exciton formation in WSe\textsubscript{2}, further supporting the idea that mechanical control can access novel electronic phenomena. These results suggest that mechanical deformation is not merely a perturbation to the electronic landscape---in certain regimes, it can be the primary architect of new physics.

\section{Gap in the Literature and Motivation for This Work}

Despite these advances, a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework connecting periodic mechanical buckling to flat-band formation and carrier localization in 2D materials has not yet been established. Most previous works focused on isolated ripples, random wrinkles, or strain engineering for band gap tuning, without systematically investigating how controlled periodic rippling could drive a transition from delocalized to localized electronic states.

This thesis addresses this gap by systematically studying how periodic sinusoidal ripples---generated via uniaxial compression---reshape the electronic band structure of TMD monolayers. By leveraging first-principles simulations and focusing on symmetry reduction, band evolution, and effective mass anisotropy, we aim to demonstrate that mechanical compression alone can create flat bands and built-in lateral heterostructures---providing a scalable, stacking-free alternative to twistronics.

In doing so, we hope to broaden the available toolkit for 2D material engineering, offering new opportunities for exciton manipulation, quantum confinement, and the exploration of correlated electronic phases.

\chapter{Approach}

\section{Computational Framework}

Our exploration into ripple-induced flat bands begins not with intricate experimental setups, but with a classic recipe: apply uniaxial compression, allow nature to find its lowest-energy configuration, and carefully observe the quantum consequences.

At the heart of this study lies monolayer MoS\textsubscript{2}, chosen in its most naturally abundant hexagonal polytype (1H-MoS\textsubscript{2})~\cite{gish2024van}. Structurally, it consists of covalently bonded sulfur–molybdenum–sulfur (S–Mo–S) sandwiches arranged into a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice.

The mechanical manipulation begins with the application of uniaxial compression along the armchair ($y$-) direction. The $x$-direction is allowed to relax, capturing the natural Poisson response. We define the compression percentage as:

\begin{equation}
    C = -100 \times \frac{\Delta L}{L_0},
\end{equation}

where $\Delta L$ is the change in the supercell length along $y$ and $L_0$ is its original, strain-free value.

To simulate mechanical behavior, we employed classical molecular dynamics simulations using the LAMMPS code~\cite{thompson2022lammps}. The reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential for MoS\textsubscript{2}~\cite{brenner1990empirical, brenner2002second, liang_parametrization_2009, stewart_atomistic_2013} was utilized to capture the bond-breaking and bond-bending phenomena necessary for buckling to occur.

After reaching mechanical equilibrium at each compression step, we transitioned to electronic structure calculations using density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the SIESTA code~\cite{soler2002siesta}. The exchange-correlation interaction was treated within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional~\cite{perdew_generalized_1996}. Norm-conserving pseudopotentials and a double-zeta polarized basis set were employed for accurate representation of electronic states.

The overall computational workflow can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Build supercells ($1\times N$) with sufficient length to allow ripple formation.
    \item Introduce slight random displacements to seed spontaneous buckling.
    \item Apply incremental uniaxial compression along $y$.
    \item Relax atomic positions via conjugate gradient minimization in LAMMPS.
    \item Export final atomic coordinates to SIESTA.
    \item Perform DFT band structure calculations on the relaxed, rippled structures.
\end{enumerate}

This two-stage LAMMPS–SIESTA pipeline allows us to capture both the mechanical deformation and its electronic consequences with high fidelity.

\section{Mechanical Simulation Details: LAMMPS Stage}

The mechanical simulations began with fully relaxed $1\times N$ rectangular supercells derived from the primitive 1H-MoS\textsubscript{2} unit cell. Compression was applied in discrete steps ranging from 0\% to approximately 20\%, with atomic positions relaxed after each step.

To avoid artificial symmetry preservation (which can artificially suppress buckling modes), small random perturbations were applied to atomic coordinates at the start of each simulation. This ensured that the system could spontaneously select buckling patterns consistent with energy minimization.

Relaxations were carried out using the conjugate gradient algorithm in LAMMPS, with convergence achieved when the maximum force on any atom fell below $0.01$~eV/\AA. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the in-plane directions, with a vacuum spacing exceeding $20$~\AA{} applied along the out-of-plane ($z$) direction to eliminate spurious interactions between periodic images.

Visual inspection and quantitative analysis confirmed the formation of smooth, sinusoidal ripples as a function of applied compression, consistent with Euler buckling expectations for thin elastic membranes.

\section{Electronic Structure Calculations: SIESTA Stage}

Electronic properties were computed using DFT within the SIESTA package, which offers efficiency for large supercells through its use of numerical atomic orbital basis sets~\cite{soler2002siesta}.

The key simulation parameters were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Exchange-Correlation Functional: GGA-PBE~\cite{perdew_generalized_1996}
    \item Basis Set: Double-zeta polarized
    \item Pseudopotentials: Norm-conserving Troullier-Martins
    \item Real-Space Mesh Cutoff: 300 Ry
    \item $\mathbf{k}$-Point Sampling: $\Gamma$-centered Monkhorst-Pack grids, minimum $8\times6$ points
    \item Electronic Temperature (Smearing): 300 K (Fermi-Dirac distribution)
    \item Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Convergence Criteria: $\Delta \rho = 10^{-5}$, $\Delta H = 10^{-4}$ eV
    \item Force Convergence Threshold: $0.01$~eV/\AA
    \item Out-of-Plane Vacuum Spacing: $>20$~\AA
\end{itemize}

The electronic temperature smearing was chosen to aid SCF convergence, particularly at higher compressions where band overlaps can arise.

To accurately capture the impact of periodic rippling on band structure, we computed band dispersions along high-symmetry paths adapted to the folded Brillouin zone of the supercells (see Figure~\ref{fig:1}).

Care was taken to ensure that k-point sampling and energy cutoffs were sufficient to resolve subtle changes in effective masses, carrier localization, and miniband formation.

\section{Model Systems and Compression Pathways}

We primarily focused on $1\times10$ and $1\times20$ supercells. These configurations were chosen to explore the role of ripple wavelength on electronic structure evolution:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $1\times10$: Shorter wavelength, sharper curvature ripples.
    \item $1\times20$: Longer wavelength, shallower curvature ripples.
\end{itemize}

By comparing these two cases, we could disentangle effects arising from curvature magnitude versus periodicity.

In addition to MoS\textsubscript{2}, similar procedures were applied to WS\textsubscript{2}, MoSe\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2} monolayers, allowing us to assess material-specific trends in buckling behavior, band flattening, and localization phenomena.

\section{Effective Mass Calculations}

To quantify the degree of band flattening and anisotropy, we computed the effective mass tensor at key band extrema using finite difference approximations:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{m^*_{ij}} = \frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{\partial^2 E(\mathbf{k})}{\partial k_i \partial k_j},
\end{equation}

where $E(\mathbf{k})$ is the energy as a function of wavevector, and $i,j$ label Cartesian coordinates.

Second derivatives were obtained via central finite differences:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial k_i^2} \approx \frac{E(k_i+\Delta k) + E(k_i-\Delta k) - 2E(k_i)}{(\Delta k)^2}.
\end{equation}

Special care was taken to choose $\Delta k$ small enough to minimize numerical artifacts, but large enough to suppress noise from the discretized mesh. Near very flat bands, higher-order fitting schemes were employed to ensure robust curvature extraction.

Transport anisotropy was assessed by comparing $m^*_{xx}$ and $m^*_{yy}$ values, revealing preferential carrier mobility along the ripple axis after symmetry breaking.

\section{Summary}

This chapter outlined the mechanical-to-electronic simulation pipeline developed to study ripple-induced flat bands in TMD monolayers. By combining LAMMPS-based mechanical deformation with SIESTA-based quantum mechanical analysis, we established a first-principles methodology capable of tracing the birth of curvature-engineered lateral heterostructures---turning ripples into fertile ground for electronic localization and flat-band formation.


\chapter{Results}

\section{Brillouin Zone Folding and Band Structure Evolution}

When a monolayer buckles under compression, its real-space periodicity changes---and, as dictated by the fundamentals of solid-state physics, its reciprocal-space structure transforms accordingly.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1}, the primitive unit cell of flat 1H-MoS\textsubscript{2} corresponds to a large Brillouin zone. When a larger $1\times N$ supercell forms due to periodic rippling, the Brillouin zone folds accordingly: it compresses along the ripple direction ($y$-axis), while the $x$-axis remains unchanged.

The irreducible wedge of the Brillouin zone (Figure~\ref{fig:1}c) shrinks proportionally with ripple periodicity. This reduction plays a crucial role in reorganizing the band structure and sets the stage for flat band emergence.

\subsection{Band Structures Across Compression}

Band structures for the $1\times10$ supercell under increasing compression are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2}. Several important features unfold as compression progresses:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item At 0\% compression, the band gap is direct at the $\mathrm{K}$ point, consistent with pristine MoS\textsubscript{2}.
    \item At small compressions (3\%-7\%), the band gap becomes indirect as the valence band maximum (VBM) shifts closer to $\Gamma$.
    \item Around 7--8\% compression, a critical crossover occurs: the VBM transitions from $\mathrm{K}$ to $\Gamma$, marking the **birth of a flat valence band**.
    \item Beyond the crossover, continued compression progressively flattens the valence band around $\Gamma$.
\end{enumerate}

This direct-to-indirect gap transition---driven entirely by mechanical deformation---reshapes the carrier dynamics and hints at forthcoming localization phenomena.

Open circles mark the computed VBM and CBM. The system transitions from direct to indirect around 7–8\% compression, coinciding with the onset of hole localization.}
\label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Band Gap Collapse and Curvature Effects}

Figure~\ref{fig:3}a summarizes the evolution of the band gap as a function of applied compression for both $1\times10$ and $1\times20$ supercells.

Key observations:

- In both cases, the band gap initially increases slightly at small compressions (consistent with strain-enhanced bonding).
- Beyond a threshold compression ($\sim$7\% for $1\times10$, $\sim$12\% for $1\times20$), the band gap sharply decreases, signaling the onset of significant electronic reconstruction.
- The shorter-wavelength ($1\times10$) ripples show faster gap collapse, indicating that local curvature---not just global strain---is the dominant driver.

This correlation is reinforced in Figure~\ref{fig:3}b, which plots maximum curvature versus compression. Sharper bends correlate directly with earlier gap closure.

\textbf{(e,f)} Effective mass evolution for valence band holes.
The hole masses exhibit a dramatic spike near the direct-to-indirect transition, particularly along the $y$-axis.}
\label{fig:3}
\end{figure}

\section{Effective Mass Evolution and Anisotropic Transport}

Carrier effective masses provide a quantitative measure of band curvature and hence mobility.

Figures~\ref{fig:3}c--f present the evolution of effective masses for both conduction electrons and valence holes along the $x$- and $y$-directions.

Highlights:

- Electron masses remain relatively modest and nearly isotropic throughout compression.
- Hole masses, in contrast, increase dramatically after the $\Gamma$-dominated flat band forms.
- Crucially, $m^*_{yy}$ (along the compression/ripple direction) becomes much larger than $m^*_{xx}$, indicating strong transport anisotropy.

In essence: after rippling, holes prefer to move along the ripple axis, while hopping across ripples becomes increasingly difficult---an emerging **quasi-1D conduction channel** for holes.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{Figures/mxxmyygamma.png}
\caption{\textbf{Effective masses of holes at $\Gamma$ for the $1\times10$ structure.}
The $y$-direction effective mass grows significantly larger than the $x$-direction mass after the band crossing transition, suggesting easier hole mobility along the ripple axis.}
\label{fig:S1}
\end{figure}

\section{Hole Localization and Strain-Defined Lateral Heterostructures}

Perhaps the most striking phenomenon observed is the spatial localization of hole states at regions of high curvature.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:4}, while electrons at the CBM remain broadly delocalized even at high compressions, holes near the VBM increasingly localize around ripple peaks and valleys.

This localization emerges gradually:

- At 0--3\% compression, both electrons and holes are delocalized.
- Around 7--8\% compression (near the band crossing), hole localization strengthens.
- Beyond 10\% compression, hole wavefunctions become strongly pinned to high-curvature regions.

A closer examination of orbital character reveals that the localized hole states primarily involve Mo 3$d_{z^2}$ and S 3$p$ orbitals---especially on the tensile sides of the ripples. Electrons, dominated by dispersive conduction bands, remain relatively insensitive to curvature.

Thus, periodic buckling transforms a chemically homogeneous monolayer into an emergent lateral heterostructure---defined purely by local curvature variations.

\end{figure}

\section{Comparative Analysis Across TMD Materials}

To test the generality of the phenomena, the same procedure was applied to WS\textsubscript{2}, MoSe\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2} monolayers.

Key results:

- All four TMDs exhibit a direct-to-indirect band gap transition under compression.
- Hole localization at ripple peaks and valleys is universally observed post-transition.
- Sulfur-based compounds (MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}) require lower critical compressions than selenium-based compounds (MoSe\textsubscript{2}, WSe\textsubscript{2}), reflecting differences in bonding strength and lattice rigidity.

Band structures and charge density plots for these additional systems are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:AppendixB}.

\section{Summary of Key Findings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Controlled uniaxial compression induces periodic rippling in TMD monolayers.
    \item Ripple formation leads to Brillouin zone folding and valence band flattening.
    \item A critical compression triggers a direct-to-indirect band gap crossover.
    \item Hole states localize at regions of maximum curvature, forming curvature-defined lateral heterostructures.
    \item The resulting system exhibits strong anisotropic hole transport along the ripple axis.
    \item These phenomena are universal across MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}, MoSe\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2}.
\end{itemize}

In short, by gently squeezing a monolayer into a wavy landscape, we can create a built-in quantum architecture---without stacking, twisting, or doping.  
Just pure curvature, carving valleys and hills in the quantum terrain.


\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}

\section{Mechanics of Ripple-Induced Band Flattening}

The emergence of flat bands in compressed, rippled MoS\textsubscript{2} monolayers reveals a powerful yet remarkably straightforward pathway for electronic structure engineering.

Our comparative study of $1\times10$ and $1\times20$ supercells pinpoints two primary ingredients behind the observed flat-band formation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Local curvature}: Sharper bends at ripple peaks and valleys dramatically modify bond angles and orbital overlaps, directly altering the local electronic structure.
    \item \textbf{Carrier localization length}: As compression increases, hole localization length shrinks below the ripple periodicity, allowing discrete charge pockets to form.
\end{itemize}

Thus, it is not compression per se, but curvature---and its modulation of quantum mechanical bonding---that acts as the true sculptor of the electronic landscape.

In this sense, curvature becomes an emergent design principle for quantum materials: a means of spatially patterning band structure without changing chemical composition.

\section{Comparison with Twistronics}

Flat bands engineered via mechanical deformation bear striking similarities to those found in twisted bilayer graphene and TMD heterostructures.

However, key differences highlight the novelty of our approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mechanism}: Moiré flat bands arise from interlayer hybridization and interference; ripple-induced flat bands stem from curvature-modulated intra-layer bonding.
    \item \textbf{Symmetry}: Twisted bilayers often preserve some hexagonal symmetry; rippled monolayers break it explicitly, inducing anisotropy.
    \item \textbf{Tunability}: Compression offers a continuous, mechanical tuning knob---potentially reversible and dynamic---unlike fixed twist angles.
    \item \textbf{Fabrication}: Ripple engineering sidesteps the stringent stacking precision required for twistronics.
\end{itemize}

In short: if twistronics is delicate cosmic origami, then rippletronics---if we may coin a term---is quantum carpentry, sculpting energy landscapes by bending rather than stacking.

\section{Symmetry Breaking and Emergent Anisotropy}

The mechanical buckling induced by uniaxial compression drives a clear sequence of symmetry reductions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item From $p3m1$ plane group symmetry (flat monolayer) to $cm$ plane group (early-stage rippling).
    \item Ultimately to $pm$ plane group symmetry (pronounced rippling).
\end{itemize}

This progressive symmetry breaking leads to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Band folding and miniband formation.
    \item Strongly anisotropic effective masses (especially for holes).
    \item Quasi-one-dimensional transport channels along the ripple axis.
\end{itemize}

Unlike in moiré systems, where some vestiges of rotational symmetry remain, rippled monolayers embrace full anisotropy---turning directional physics from a side effect into a design feature.

\section{Opportunities and Challenges for Correlated Phases}

The flattening of valence bands and the localization of hole states suggest a promising playground for exploring strong correlation effects---Mott transitions, heavy fermion behavior, perhaps even unconventional superconductivity.

However, we must also acknowledge important limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single-particle nature of DFT}: Our simulations capture band flattening, but not many-body correlation physics. Exploring true emergent correlated states will require higher-level techniques such as DMFT, GW-BSE, or quantum Monte Carlo.
    \item \textbf{Thermal fluctuations}: Ripple-induced localization is robust at room temperature given the energy scales involved ($\sim$100 meV), but fine details of many-body phenomena could be sensitive to thermal decoherence.
    \item \textbf{Experimental realization}: Achieving large, uniform compressive strains without fracture remains a challenge. Localized regions (e.g., near nano-indenters or patterned substrates) may offer realistic platforms for testing these ideas experimentally.
\end{itemize}

Thus, this thesis lays a strong foundation---but the full story of correlated phases in rippled TMDs remains an exciting frontier for future exploration.

\section{Implications for Device Applications}

Curvature-engineered flat bands and lateral heterostructures open several promising avenues for device innovation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strain-gated transistors}: Localized strain fields could dynamically tune conductivity, offering flexible electronic switches.
    \item \textbf{Quantum confinement without interfaces}: Ripple peaks and valleys naturally create quantum wells and barriers without introducing chemical disorder.
    \item \textbf{Exciton funneling devices}: Built-in strain gradients could direct exciton migration, enhancing photovoltaic or light-emission efficiencies.
    \item \textbf{Anisotropic electronics}: Strong directionality in carrier transport could enable ultra-low-power one-dimensional logic circuits.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, sulfur-based TMDs (MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2})---requiring lower compressions for localization---are especially attractive candidates for flexible device architectures.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}

\subsection{Effect of Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC)}

The present calculations omit explicit spin-orbit coupling. Including SOC would introduce a splitting of the valence bands at $\mathrm{K}$ (typically 100–400 meV~\cite{Zhu2011, Kormanyos2015}).  
However, preliminary tests suggest that SOC shifts the absolute band energies but does not qualitatively alter the $\Gamma$-dominated flat band formation or the resulting localization phenomena.  
Future work incorporating SOC self-consistently would further validate this conclusion.

\subsection{Band Gap Underestimation by GGA-DFT}

It is well known that GGA functionals such as PBE systematically underestimate absolute band gaps~\cite{perdew_generalized_1996}.  
Hybrid functional calculations (e.g., HSE06~\cite{heyd2003hybrid, heyd2004assessment}) on selected structures confirm that while absolute gap values increase, the trend of decreasing gap with compression and the direct-to-indirect transition are preserved.  
Thus, the qualitative evolution reported here remains robust.

\subsection{Strain Feasibility}

The critical compressions predicted (7–13\%) approach the fracture strain range of monolayer MoS\textsubscript{2} (6–11\%)~\cite{bertolazzi2011stretching, castellanos2013local}.  
Localized rippling through substrate engineering, thermal mismatch, or nanoindentation offers promising routes to realize the necessary conditions experimentally.

\section{Conclusion}

This thesis demonstrates that periodic mechanical rippling---induced by uniaxial compression---provides a simple, scalable, and powerful method to engineer flat bands, carrier localization, and lateral heterostructures in 2D TMD monolayers.

Major conclusions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Controlled compression leads to ripple formation, symmetry breaking, and Brillouin zone folding.
    \item A critical mechanical transition gives birth to flat valence bands at $\Gamma$.
    \item Hole states localize at high-curvature regions, forming built-in lateral heterostructures.
    \item Strong anisotropic transport emerges, with holes favoring motion along the ripple axis.
    \item These effects are universal across MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}, MoSe\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2}.
\end{itemize}

Perhaps most remarkably, this entire architecture emerges from pure mechanical curvature---without twisting, stacking, doping, or external fields.

It is a testament to the richness of two-dimensional physics that simply bending a monolayer, much like bending a musical instrument, can tune its quantum symphony.

\chapter{Effective Mass Calculations}
\label{app:AppendixA}

\section{Theory of Effective Mass}

In crystalline solids, the effective mass tensor characterizes how a charge carrier (electron or hole) responds to applied forces.  
Formally, it is defined through the second derivative of the band energy $E(\mathbf{k})$ with respect to the crystal momentum $\mathbf{k}$:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{m^*_{ij}} = \frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{\partial^2 E(\mathbf{k})}{\partial k_i \partial k_j},
\end{equation}

where $i,j$ label Cartesian directions.  
Large band curvature corresponds to small effective mass (light carriers), while flat bands produce heavy effective masses (slow carriers).

For parabolic bands, this description is exact; for more complex dispersions, it provides a local approximation near extrema (e.g., conduction band minima or valence band maxima).

\section{Numerical Implementation}

Since $E(\mathbf{k})$ is computed numerically at discrete points in the Brillouin zone, we approximate second derivatives using central finite differences:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial k_i^2} \approx \frac{E(k_i+\Delta k) + E(k_i-\Delta k) - 2E(k_i)}{(\Delta k)^2},
\end{equation}

where $\Delta k$ is a small displacement along the $k_i$ axis.

\subsection{Choosing $\Delta k$}

Selecting $\Delta k$ is a balancing act:

- If $\Delta k$ is too large, the curvature estimate becomes inaccurate due to non-parabolic band features.
- If $\Delta k$ is too small, numerical noise from the DFT grid dominates.

For this study, $\Delta k$ values were chosen on a case-by-case basis to optimize stability, typically corresponding to 5–10\% of the reciprocal lattice vector spacing.

\subsection{Flat Band Challenges}

For extremely flat bands (such as those near the $\Gamma$ point after significant compression), curvature becomes very small---and correspondingly, effective mass formally diverges.

In practice, to handle near-zero curvatures:

- Finer $k$-point sampling was employed around $\Gamma$.
- Polynomial fits to the local band dispersion were used when necessary.
- Effective mass results for extremely flat bands should be interpreted as lower bounds: numerically, true infinite mass is elusive.

Thus, whenever we report large effective masses (e.g., for holes along the ripple direction), the values represent strong flattening---even if practical divergence is smoothed by computational resolution.

\section{Anisotropy Analysis}

Ripple-induced symmetry breaking naturally introduces transport anisotropy.

To quantify this, we compute the mass anisotropy ratio:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Anisotropy Ratio} = \frac{m^*_{yy}}{m^*_{xx}},
\end{equation}

where $m^*_{yy}$ and $m^*_{xx}$ are the hole effective masses along and across the ripple axis, respectively.

In post-crossover structures (after the direct-to-indirect band transition):

- The anisotropy ratio routinely exceeds 3.
- This implies that holes move more easily \textit{along} the ripples than across them.
- Rippled TMDs effectively behave like natural quantum nanowires for hole transport.

Thus, effective mass analysis not only captures band flattening but also unveils the emergent one-dimensional character of charge dynamics in strained 2D systems.

\chapter{Results for Other TMDs}
\label{app:AppendixB}

\section{Band Structures under Compression}

To evaluate the universality of ripple-induced electronic phenomena, we extended our mechanical compression study to three additional monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs): MoSe\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2}.

Figures~\ref{fig:S4}--\ref{fig:S6} present the evolution of the band structures for $1\times10$ supercells of these materials across a range of compressions.

Several general trends emerge:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All systems exhibit a transition from a direct band gap at the $\mathrm{K}$ point to an indirect gap at $\Gamma$ beyond a critical compression.
    \item The degree of band flattening near $\Gamma$ increases with compression, leading to enhanced hole effective masses and suggesting the onset of localization.
    \item Selenium-based compounds (MoSe\textsubscript{2}, WSe\textsubscript{2}) require slightly higher critical compressions compared to sulfur-based compounds (MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}), reflecting the softer lattice constants and weaker bond stiffness associated with heavier chalcogens.
\end{itemize}

Thus, curvature-engineered flat band formation appears to be a robust and universal phenomenon across group-VI TMDs.

While WSe\textsubscript{2} requires higher compressions to trigger the transition, significant flattening of the valence band near $\Gamma$ is ultimately observed.}
\label{fig:S6}
\end{figure}

\section{Localization of Hole States}

To probe carrier localization under compression, Figures~\ref{fig:S9}--\ref{fig:S11} plot the probability densities for conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) states for each material across selected compression levels.

Key findings:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For all TMDs, conduction electrons remain broadly delocalized, even after substantial buckling.
    \item Hole states progressively localize at ripple peaks and valleys after the direct-to-indirect transition.
    \item Sulfur-containing compounds (MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}) display slightly sharper hole localization at lower compressions than selenium compounds (MoSe\textsubscript{2}, WSe\textsubscript{2}), consistent with their stronger orbital hybridization under strain.
\end{itemize}

Thus, the formation of curvature-defined lateral heterostructures by mechanical compression appears to be a **generalizable design rule** for 2D TMD monolayers.

\label{fig:S11}
\end{figure}

\section{Summary}

The behavior observed in MoS\textsubscript{2}---band flattening, direct-to-indirect transitions, and curvature-induced hole localization---extends robustly across multiple group-VI TMD monolayers.

Although critical compression thresholds vary slightly depending on chalcogen species, the underlying physics appears universal:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mechanical buckling} reorganizes the band structure in all materials studied.
    \item \textbf{Curvature-driven flat bands} emerge at the valence band edge after sufficient compression.
    \item \textbf{Hole states localize} at ripple-induced potential wells, while electron states remain delocalized.
\end{itemize}

Thus, mechanical curvature emerges as a general strategy for engineering quantum states in flexible, atomically thin materials.

\chapter{Primer on Band Theory, DFT, and Rippling Physics}
\label{app:AppendixC}

\section{Electronic Band Theory Basics}

In crystalline solids, the periodic arrangement of atoms gives rise to energy bands---allowed ranges of electron energies---separated by forbidden gaps.

Key concepts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bloch's Theorem}: Electronic wavefunctions in a periodic potential take the form $\psi_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r}) = e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} u_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r})$, where $u_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r})$ has the periodicity of the lattice.
    \item \textbf{Band Structure}: Solving the Schrödinger equation with a periodic potential yields a dispersion relation $E(\mathbf{k})$ between energy and crystal momentum.
    \item \textbf{Effective Mass}: Near band extrema (e.g., conduction minima, valence maxima), carriers behave like free particles but with modified inertia determined by band curvature.
    \item \textbf{Flat Bands}: Bands with very low dispersion ($\partial^2 E/\partial k^2 \approx 0$) correspond to localized electronic states and high density of states---fertile ground for correlation-driven phenomena.
\end{itemize}

\section{Density Functional Theory (DFT) Overview}

Density functional theory (DFT) provides a practical framework for calculating electronic structures of many-body systems based on the electron density $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ rather than the full many-electron wavefunction.

Key principles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hohenberg-Kohn Theorems}: The ground-state properties of an interacting electron system are uniquely determined by its ground-state density.
    \item \textbf{Kohn-Sham Equations}: A fictitious system of non-interacting electrons is introduced, whose density matches that of the real system, greatly simplifying calculations.
    \item \textbf{Exchange-Correlation Functional}: The many-body effects are encapsulated in an approximate exchange-correlation energy functional. Common approximations include LDA, GGA (e.g., PBE used here).
    \item \textbf{Band Gap Underestimation}: Standard DFT functionals typically underestimate semiconductor band gaps, though trends in band structure evolution (e.g., under strain) are often reliable.
\end{itemize}

In this work, DFT calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and norm-conserving pseudopotentials.

\section{Physics of Rippling and Buckling in 2D Materials}

Unlike bulk crystals, two-dimensional materials like MoS\textsubscript{2} have extraordinary flexibility in-plane but are easily perturbed out-of-plane.

Key mechanical behaviors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Buckling Instability}: When compressive strain exceeds a critical value, a flat sheet minimizes its elastic energy by forming periodic out-of-plane ripples.
    \item \textbf{Sinusoidal Rippling}: At moderate strains, the ripples tend to assume sinusoidal profiles, characterized by a wavelength $\lambda$ and amplitude $A$.
    \item \textbf{Strain-Defined Potentials}: In strained 2D materials, local variations in curvature and strain can modulate electronic band edges, effectively creating built-in potential landscapes without chemical heterogeneity.
    \item \textbf{Curvature-Induced Band Modulation}: Bond angles and orbital overlaps are highly sensitive to curvature, leading to shifts in conduction and valence band energies at the atomic scale.
\end{itemize}

In the systems studied here, rippling induced by uniaxial compression along the armchair direction leads to a periodic modulation of the valence band, promoting flat band formation and hole localization.

\section{Summary}

This primer provides essential background for understanding the key physical mechanisms underlying the results presented in the main thesis:

- How periodic potentials sculpt electronic bands.
- How DFT enables their computation.
- How mechanical deformation---particularly rippling---can act as an emergent tool for band engineering in two-dimensional materials.

The interplay between crystal symmetry, electronic structure, and mechanical geometry stands at the heart of the phenomena investigated in this work.

          , 
            
              Recently, it has been revealed that dark excitons play a significant role in optically controlled information processing due to their much longer radiative lifetimes than those of bright ones. For the realizable implementation of the features, it is important to understand and manipulate conditions in which dark excitons could exist. We adopt strain-engineered rippling as a new parameter for the modification of the electronic structure of monolayer MoS
              2
              and demonstrate the efficient conversion of bright to dark excitons
              via
              a first-principles study. For rippled monolayer MoS
              2
              above a strain of ∼6.8\%, we show that the spin order of the conduction band is reversed and the spin forbidden dark exciton then goes below the bright one.},

By first-principles calculations we show that the bandgap of rippled MoS2 monolayer can be tuned in a large range by vertical external electric field, which is expected to have little effect on MoS2 monolayer. This phenomenon can be explained from charge redistribution under external electric field by a simple model. This may open an avenue of optimizing monolayer MoS2 for electronic and optoelectronic applications by surface patterning.},

Here our extensive first-principles calculations reveal that structural wrinkling and corrugation will cause significant flexoelectricity in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers. The flexoelectricity is induced by the strain gradients created along the finite thickness of the wrinkled TMD monolayers and becomes more dominant in determining out-of-plane polarizations with decreasing wavelengths of the TMD wrinkles. According to the first-principles calculations and whole structural symmetry, a theoretical model is developed to describe the total out-of-plane polarizations and flexoelectric effect of the wrinkled TMD monolayers. The unveiled flexoelectricity in monolayer TMDs highlights a potential for their application in energy conversion devices.},

A previously parameterized interatomic potential combining the reactive empirical bond-order and Lennard-Jones potentials is implemented into the LAMMPS molecular simulation package and refined for improved prediction of the mechanical properties of MoS2 at athermal conditions. Nanoindentation simulations are performed using three indenter sizes with specific focus on the incipient plastic deformation event within the MoS2single crystal. MS calculations show that a local phase transformation occurs beneath the indenter at plastic yield without the presence of broken Mo–S bonds. The structural characteristics of the phase transformation are captured using a slip vector analysis. The nanoindentation simulations provide insight into the mechanical response of MoS2 during contact deformation characteristic of both synthesis and application for better design of MoS2 nanoparticle lubricants.},

The fitting scheme used for this potential is optimized by appropriate selection of the functions, training databases, initial guesses, and weights on each residual—the four factors that are involved in a weighted nonlinear least-squares fitting. The resulting potential is able to yield good agreement with the structure and energetics of Mo molecules, two-dimensional Mo structures, three-dimensional Mo crystals, small S molecules, and binary Mo-S crystal structures. We illustrate the capabilities of the new potential by presenting results of the simulation of friction between MoS2 layers. The results are consistent with our previous static potential surface calculations using density-functional theory.},

	abstract = {Dimensionality plays an essential role in determining the anomalous non-Fermi liquid properties in heavy fermion systems. So far most heavy fermion compounds are quasi-two-dimensional or three-dimensional. Here we report the synthesis and systematic investigations of the single crystals of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice CeCo2Ga8. Resistivity measurements at ambient pressure reveal the onset of coherence at T * ≈ 20 K and non-Fermi liquid behavior with linear temperature dependence over a decade in temperature from 2 to 0.1 K. The specific heat increases logarithmically with lowering temperature between 10 and 2 K and reaches 800 mJ/mol K2 at 1 K, suggesting that CeCo2Ga8 is a heavy fermion compound in the close vicinity of a quantum critical point. Resistivity measurements under pressure further confirm the non-Fermi liquid behavior in a large temperature–pressure range. The magnetic susceptibility is found to follow the typical behavior for a one-dimensional spin chain from 300 K down to T *, and first-principles calculations predict flat Fermi surfaces for the itinerant f-electron bands. These suggest that CeCo2Ga8 is a rare example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice, but its non-Fermi liquid behaviors resemble those of the quasi-two-dimensional YbRh2Si2 family. The study of the quasi-one-dimensional CeCo2Ga8 family may therefore help us to understand the role of dimensionality on heavy fermion physics and quantum criticality.},
