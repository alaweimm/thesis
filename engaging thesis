\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis explores how periodic rippling in 2D group-VI TMD monolayers---such as MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}, MoSe\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2}---can flatten their electronic bands under compression. Through first-principles simulations, we trace the formation of periodic ripples and show that, beyond a certain compression, flat valence bands emerge in these otherwise semiconducting TMDs.\ In particular, a gradual mechanical-electronic transition unfolds:\ initial deformation leads to buckling, which triggers the formation of ripples---much like a thin sheet forced to bend under pressure.\ As the compression increases, the valence band evolves in character.\ The $\Gamma$-point (which hosts a nearly flat segment along the $\overline{\Gamma X}$ direction) rises in energy, while the K-point (initially the valence band maximum) drops.\ At a critical compression, these levels cross---signaling the birth of a flat valence band and a fundamental shift in the material’s electronic properties.\ What results is a built-in lateral potential landscape---a heterostructure embedded within a single, chemically uniform monolayer, achieved without chemical doping, stacking, or twist-angle engineering.\ Curvature drives this transformation, and the outcome is striking:\ heave-hole are pinned in high-curvature regions, while electrons remain free to move.\ This asymmetry opens new possibilities for exciton trapping, hole-based electronics, and the study of correlated electronic phases in 2D systems.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Daryl Chrzan, who took me under his wing and bravely accepted the challenge of supervising a student who could debug DFT codes but not his own sleep schedule. He maintained clarity (and, against all odds, sanity) throughout the carnival ride that is advising a PhD student---complete with wild pivots, chaotic drafts, and enough ``I swear I'm almost done'' moments to power a small city. His day-to-day mentorship and sharp, no-nonsense insight helped shape not just the scientific direction of this work, but also the way I think as a researcher. Over the years, I tested the limits of both our research tools and his patience, throwing at him a full buffet of challenges and academic misadventures---occasional detours, procrastination marathons, half-baked ideas, codes that broke for reasons even the compiler refused to explain, mysterious \LaTeX\, bugs, and the kind of nonlinear progress only a PhD student can deliver. And in the middle of it all, there was a fishing trip---an allegory for my early experiments, perhaps, hoping nature would inspire clarity. I cast with optimism and caught nothing but confusion, tangled line, and a sunburn so complete it could have been peer-reviewed. Yet somehow, he let me stay in the program and did not revoke my lab access. That is mentorship. He endured it all and remained calm, humorous, and far more tolerant than I had any right to expect. For that---and for not abandoning me at sea---I am deeply thankful.

I am also profoundly grateful to my advisor, Professor Ali Javey, for his unwavering support throughout my time in the program, for letting me run with this idea, and for entrusting me with the freedom and flexibility to pursue this research direction. His strategic oversight and guidance helped make this work possible. My sincere thanks also go to Professor Boubacar Kant\'e for serving on my dissertation committee and for offering valuable feedback that helped strengthen this work. I am thankful to Dr. Joel Ager for his collaboration and contributions as a co-author, and to the broader team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for their support.

\chapter{Introduction}

One of the most exciting stories in two-dimensional (2D) materials has been the rise of flat electronic bands. In twisted bilayer graphene, even a tiny rotation produces a \textit{moir\'e superlattice}---think of overlaying two chicken-wire meshes to create a large-scale interference pattern---and this dramatically reshapes the electrons’ energy landscape~\cite{gish2024van}.\ Electrons in these flat bands barely move; their kinetic energy plummets, interactions take center stage, and a whole zoo of exotic states emerges. Researchers have observed unconventional superconductivity~\cite{po2018origin, cao2018unconventional, isobe2018unconventional, wu2018theory, lian2019twisted, chou2019superconductor, codecido2019correlated, yankowitz2019tuning, saito2020independent, shavit2021theory, oh2021evidence}, unusual magnetism~\cite{gonzalez2017electrically, sboychakov2018externally, sharpe2019emergent, wolf2019electrically, li2020experimental, pons2020flat, klebl2021importance, vahedi2021magnetism}, strange metal behavior with linear-in-temperature resistivity~\cite{polshyn2019large, wu2019phonon, cao2020strange}, intrinsic quantized anomalous Hall effects~\cite{serlin2020intrinsic, bultinck2020mechanism, liu2021theories}, and correlated insulating phases~\cite{cao2018correlated, po2018origin, yuan2018model, padhi2018doped, ochi2018possible, zhang2020correlated, nuckolls2020strongly, da2021correlation, liu2021tuning, pierce2021unconventional}. The direct visualization of these flat bands~\cite{utama2021visualization} confirmed their critical role, helping launch the new field of \textit{twistronics}~\cite{ciarrocchi2022excitonic}.

But as dazzling as twistronics is, it demands exquisitely controlled layer alignments---a bit like trying to tune a cosmic radio station. This naturally leads to a question: Could there be a simpler way to flatten electronic bands without twisting layers? It turns out, the answer is yes. In this thesis, we present a refreshingly direct approach: achieving flat bands through mechanical deformation. Instead of twisting two layers, we \textit{bend} one. Specifically, we study how uniaxial compression---applied along the armchair direction---leads monolayer MoS\textsubscript{2} and related transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to buckle, ripple, and ultimately reshape their electronic structure.

The key insight motivating this work is that the band gap of TMD monolayers is highly strain-sensitive~\cite{Trainer2019}. You can think of the band gap like the pitch of a taut guitar string: tweak the tension (apply strain), and the note changes.\ So if strain varies spatially---say, due to rippling---then the band gap varies across the sheet too. In effect, spatially graded strain carves out built-in lateral heterostructures, no chemical patterning required.

Using \textit{ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore the feasibility of creating such strain-induced heterostructures in MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}, MoSe\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2}. Notably, in MoS\textsubscript{2} and WS\textsubscript{2}, hole localization occurs at relatively modest compressions compared to their selenium-based cousins, MoSe\textsubscript{2} and WSe\textsubscript{2}. Therefore, we focus primarily on MoS\textsubscript{2} in this work.

When compressed sufficiently, the monolayer ripples, breaking its original threefold symmetry. This symmetry breaking impacts all tensor properties: thermal and electrical conductivity, for instance, become anisotropic. In particular, rippling creates a strain-induced lateral heterostructure where holes are localized in the high-curvature troughs and peaks of the sinusoidal buckling pattern. Most strikingly, the valence band become remarkably flat. Controlled compression thus becomes a new knob for band engineering, expanding the toolkit beyond stacking and twisting. By exploring strain as a route to flat bands, we aim to contribute to the broader understanding of correlated quantum phenomena in 2D materials. In short: while our colleagues in twistronics have perfected the art of cosmic origami, we propose that sometimes, simply giving a monolayer a gentle squeeze can be equally transformative.


\chapter{Literature Review}

The quest for flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) materials did not stop at twisted bilayer graphene. Researchers quickly realized that moir\'e flat bands could emerge in a range of van der Waals (vdW) systems~\cite{an2021emergence, zhao2020formation, naik2018ultraflatbands, wu2018hubbard, wu2019topological, ruiz2019interlayer, zhan2020tunability}. Materials like $\gamma$-graphyne, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) joined the party---each offering its own twist (sometimes literally) on the flat-band phenomenon.

However, while twisted bilayer graphene showcases a celebrated ``magic angle'' near $1.1^\circ$ that optimizes flatness, not every material is quite so fussy. In materials like hBN, MoS\textsubscript{2}, and $\gamma$-graphyne, flat bands emerge without the need for fine-tuning a specific critical angle. Instead, once the twist angle becomes small enough, the system naturally crosses over into a flat-band regime, where the electronic bandwidth shrinks to a scale comparable to Coulomb interactions. In these cases, magic is replaced with good old-fashioned patience.

Experimental and theoretical studies have expanded this story in TMDs specifically. Twisted bilayer WSe\textsubscript{2}, for instance, shows flat bands at twist angles between about $4^\circ$ and $5^\circ$~\cite{wang2020correlated}. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy reveal localization patterns in WSe\textsubscript{2}/WS\textsubscript{2} heterostructures that depend sensitively on twist angle~\cite{li2021imaging}. Researchers have also probed phenomena such as flat-band plasmons in twisted MoS\textsubscript{2}~\cite{kuang2022flat} and highlighted the essential role of spin-orbit coupling in TMD heterobilayers~\cite{rademaker2022spin}. Collectively, these findings emphasize that TMDs are rich playgrounds where flat bands drive exotic electronic behaviors, much like their graphene-based cousins.

That said, nearly all prior explorations of flat bands in TMDs have focused on layer stacking and twisting as the key control knobs. The idea that mechanical deformation alone could induce flat bands---without twisting or stacking---remains relatively unexplored. This gap sets the stage for the present work. While the mechanical properties of vdW 2D materials---including their propensity for \textit{buckling} under strain---have been widely studied~\cite{dai2019strain, qi2023recent, li_buckling_2021, han_buckling_2021, li_molecular_2019}, most previous efforts focused on mechanical behavior itself, not the electronic consequences. Ripples were regarded more as curiosities or mechanical challenges than as opportunities for electronic innovation.

Still, there were hints. Shi et al.~\cite{shi_flexoelectricity_2018} showed that buckling of a MoSe\textsubscript{2} monolayer induces flexoelectric dipoles---essentially creating tiny electric fields just from bending. Qi et al.~\cite{qi_bandgap_2013} predicted that the band gap of MoS\textsubscript{2} could be tuned by combining compression with an external electric field, exploiting these curvature-induced dipoles. They even observed a direct-to-indirect gap transition for ripples aligned along the zigzag direction (but not the armchair, interestingly enough).

However, earlier studies did not deeply explore how periodic mechanical deformation could modulate the electronic band structure---particularly whether it could drive flat band formation or carrier localization. Nor did they treat rippling as a way to engineer lateral heterostructures without any chemical or compositional changes.

More recently, additional work has nudged the door open. Xu et al.~\cite{xu2021moire} and Pasquale et al.~\cite{pasquale2023electrical} have begun studying moiré superlattices in TMDs from the perspective of charge localization, and Lee et al.~\cite{lee_strain-induced_2023} found that strain could lead to dark exciton formation via band structure reshaping. Yet a comprehensive framework tying mechanical buckling to flat-band emergence and lateral heterostructure formation remains missing.

This thesis aims to fill that gap. We systematically explore how controlled uniaxial compression, leading to periodic rippling, reshapes the electronic properties of MoS\textsubscript{2} and related TMD monolayers. Along the way, we hope to show that sometimes, by simply giving a monolayer the right kind of squeeze, we can unlock flat bands---no twisting, no stacking, and no magic angles required. Just a little mechanical mischief, properly deployed.


\chapter{Approach}

Our exploration into ripple-induced flat bands starts not with exotic experimental setups, but with a classic recipe: apply uniaxial compression, wait for nature to do its thing, and carefully watch what happens at the quantum level. This chapter details the computational framework and simulation strategies we used to squeeze, bend, and electronically probe monolayer MoS\textsubscript{2} and related TMDs---all without ever leaving the digital laboratory.

\section{Computational Framework}

At the heart of this study is monolayer MoS\textsubscript{2} in its most naturally abundant hexagonal polytype, 1H-MoS\textsubscript{2} (Figure~\ref{fig:1}). Structurally, it consists of covalently bonded sulfur–molybdenum–sulfur (S–Mo–S) sandwiches stacked into a two-dimensional sheet. Our primary interest lies in what happens when we apply compression along the armchair direction---aligned here with the $y$-axis. 

Compression was applied incrementally using the LAMMPS code~\cite{thompson2022lammps}, employing the reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential~\cite{brenner1990empirical, brenner2002second}. We define the compression percentage as:
\begin{equation}
    C = -100 \times \frac{\Delta L}{L_0},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta L$ is the change in length from the equilibrium configuration and $L_0$ is the original length at zero strain. Compression steps ranged from 0\% to 20\%.

After each incremental squish, the structures were relaxed using a conjugate gradient algorithm until the forces on all atoms dropped below $0.01$~eV/\AA. A generous vacuum spacing of $>20$~\AA{} was applied normal to the monolayer to eliminate any illusory neighbor interactions courtesy of periodic boundary conditions.

Once mechanically buckled, these strained supercells graduated to the electronic structure stage. We imported them into the SIESTA package~\cite{soler2002siesta} for density functional theory (DFT) calculations, using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional~\cite{perdew_generalized_1996}. Norm-conserving pseudopotentials and a double-zeta polarized basis set captured the quantum dynamics of our unwillingly deformed monolayers.

Other computational details:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-space grid energy cutoff: 300 Ry
    \item $\Gamma$-centered Monkhorst-Pack \textbf{k}-point grid: minimum $8\times6$
    \item Fermi-Dirac smearing temperature: 300 K (to help when things got metallic)
    \item SCF convergence thresholds: $\Delta \rho = 10^{-5}$, $\Delta H = 10^{-4}$~eV
\end{itemize}

In short: LAMMPS bent the sheets; SIESTA told us what quantum chaos ensued.

\section{Simulation Details}

\subsection{LAMMPS Simulations}

Our mechanical simulations used the REBO-MoS\textsubscript{2} potential developed by Liang et al.~\cite{liang_parametrization_2009}, tweaked slightly by Stewart et al.~\cite{stewart_atomistic_2013} for better strain behavior.

We started with fully relaxed $1\times N$ rectangular supercells. Small random displacements were added to the atomic positions---just enough to break perfect symmetry and coax buckling to occur when compressed. (Left to their own devices, atoms prefer lazy flatness unless nudged otherwise.) Compression was then applied along the $y$-axis, while allowing the $x$-axis to relax freely---capturing any Poisson effect naturally. Energy minimization was carried out using the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm embedded within LAMMPS~\cite{thompson2022lammps}.

The resulting rippled structures---graceful sinusoidal waves at the macro-scale, hideously stressed bonds at the atomic scale---were then exported for full electronic structure analysis.

\subsection{SIESTA Simulations}

SIESTA~\cite{soler2002siesta} provided the quantum microscope to inspect how periodic rippling impacts the electronic bands. Its efficiency with localized basis sets made it ideal for handling the large supercells required here.

The DFT parameters, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:siesta_params}, balanced computational tractability with the need for accurate curvature-sensitive electronic features.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{\textbf{Summary of SIESTA Simulation Parameters}}

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}

Smearing Temperature & 300 K \\

Force Convergence & $<0.01$ eV/\AA \\
Vacuum Level & $>20$ \AA \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The smearing temperature helped avoid numerical headaches when the system flirted with metallicity at higher compressions. The stringent force convergence ensured that electronic properties reflected the true relaxed buckled shapes---not strained approximations.

Thus, through this two-stage LAMMPS–SIESTA pipeline, we set the stage for observing how gentle (and sometimes not-so-gentle) mechanical persuasion reshapes quantum realities in 2D TMDs.


\chapter{Results}

\section{Brillouin Zone and Band Structure Evolution}

As soon as a monolayer buckles under compression, its real-space periodicity changes---and so does its reciprocal space. Figure~\ref{fig:1}b shows how the Brillouin zone evolves: starting from the primitive $1\times1$ unit cell, the introduction of a larger $M\times N$ supercell compresses the Brillouin zone vertically while leaving the horizontal width ($\pi/a$) unchanged. In simple terms, buckling doesn’t just ripple atoms---it ripples the quantum landscape.

Figure~\ref{fig:1}c highlights the irreducible wedge of this new Brillouin zone. As $N$ increases, the wedge shrinks vertically, corresponding to the longer real-space rippling wavelength. This reduction plays a central role in reorganizing the band structure, setting the stage for flatness to emerge.

Band structures for the $1\times10$ supercell are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2}, spanning six different compression levels. Two major phenomena leap out as compression increases: First, the system undergoes a direct-to-indirect band gap transition. At 0\% compression, the band gap is direct at the $\mathrm{K}$ point---just as pristine monolayer MoS\textsubscript{2} should be. Initially, compression slightly increases the gap, hinting that moderate squeezing strengthens the electronic bonds.\ (It also shifts the VBM and CBM locations a little tiny bit, hence making it indirect.) But as buckling sets in, the gap starts shrinking. Around 7–8\% compression, a tipping point is reached: the valence band maximum (VBM) hops from $\mathrm{K}$ to $\Gamma$, making the gap ``very'' indirect. (If bands could file travel itineraries, this one just changed airports.) This is what we would call here the ``cross-over point.''

Second, compression becomes a band gap tuning knob. Figure~\ref{fig:3}a plots the band gap as a function of compression for $1\times10$ and $1\times20$ structures. The gap shrinks faster for shorter wavelength ripples ($1\times10$), suggesting that maximum curvature---rather than just compression---is key. Figure~\ref{fig:3}b confirms this: structures with higher local curvature correlate with faster gap collapse. In short, sharper bends mean quicker band reshaping.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

\textbf{(e,f)} Effective mass evolution for holes at the VBM.

\end{figure}

\section{Effective Mass Analysis}

Effective mass provides a direct window into carrier mobility and band curvature: lighter masses mean fast-moving carriers, heavier masses mean flat bands and sluggish motion. Figures~\ref{fig:3}c--\ref{fig:3}f plot the evolution of effective masses with compression.

At small compressions, the effective masses behave politely, varying smoothly. But cross-over point---around 7–8\% for $1\times10$, 12–13\% for $1\times20$---the hole effective mass explodes. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The magnitude of hole mass ($m^*$) increases in both $x$ and $y$ directions.
    \item The $y$-direction mass skyrockets and becomes much larger than the $x$-direction mass, indicating strong transport anisotropy.
\end{itemize}

This mass explosion signifies that the valence band has flattened near $\Gamma$, a precursor to carrier localization. Figure~\ref{fig:S1} makes the anisotropy crystal clear: after the transition, holes prefer to ``creep'' along the ripple direction rather than cross the peaks and valleys. (If you were carrying a heavy backpack, you'd stick to the valley floor too.)

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{Figures/mxxmyygamma.png}
\caption{\label{fig:S1} \textbf{Effective masses of holes at $\Gamma$ for the $1\times10$ structure.}
The $y$-direction mass grows much faster than the $x$-direction mass after the band crossing transition, suggesting easier hole mobility along the ripple axis.}
\end{figure}



\section{Hole Localization and Formation of Lateral Heterostructures}

Compression does more than just nudge the band edges around---at higher strains, it fundamentally reshapes where carriers live. Figure~\ref{fig:4} shows the probability densities of the valence and conduction band states for a $1\times10$ MoS\textsubscript{2} cell at various compressions.

Below the direct-to-indirect transition, both electron and hole states are broadly delocalized across the entire structure, as one would expect for a pristine 2D semiconductor. But above the transition---after about 8\% compression---the holes develop a strong preference: they cozy up to the regions of \textbf{highest curvature}, namely the ripple peaks and valleys. (Think of these sites as the luxury penthouses of the bent crystal landscape.)

A closer look reveals that the localized hole states primarily involve the Mo 3$d_{z^2}$ and S 3$p$ orbitals---especially on the tensile side of the bent ripples. Meanwhile, electrons at the conduction band minimum (CBM) remain distributed rather uniformly, refusing to be impressed by the wavy terrain.


Thus, the buckled structure effectively transforms into a strain-induced lateral heterostructure different regions defined not by different chemical compositions, but by local variations in bending curvature. 

Interestingly, when inspecting charge densities at individual $k$-points, one finds that states are localized either at ripple peaks or valleys---but not both simultaneously. If one plots the total density plot (summed over many $k$-points), this distinction averages out, preserving the overall symmetry as shown in the LDOS plot.

Holes localize strongly at regions of maximum curvature beyond 8\% compression, while electrons remain delocalized.}
\end{figure*}

\section{Comparative Analysis Across Different TMDs}

To see whether this behavior was a quirk of MoS\textsubscript{2} or a general TMD trend, we repeated the full compression sweep for $1\times10$ WS\textsubscript{2}, MoSe\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2}. Their band structures are plotted in Figures~\ref{fig:S3}--\ref{fig:S6}.

Two important patterns emerge:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All four TMDs exhibit the direct-to-indirect band crossing, followed by hole localization at high curvature. In other words, buckling-induced heterostructures are a \textit{general phenomenon}, not a MoS\textsubscript{2} fluke.
    \item Sulfur-containing compounds (MoS\textsubscript{2} and WS\textsubscript{2}) undergo the band crossing at lower compressions than selenium-based compounds (MoSe\textsubscript{2} and WSe\textsubscript{2}). This hints at a link between the lighter chalcogen atom and easier mechanical deformation.
\end{itemize}

Figures~\ref{fig:S8}--\ref{fig:S11} show the corresponding charge densities. The same story repeats: after the critical compression, holes pin themselves at ripple peaks and valleys, while electrons roam free. Thus, rippling provides a universal, composition-independent pathway for inducing flat bands and lateral heterostructures in TMD monolayers. It's less of a materials-specific trick and more of a physics principle: bend it, and they (holes) will come.

\section{Summary of Key Findings}

The results presented above reveal a coherent, compelling picture:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct-to-indirect band transitions} occur universally in rippled TMDs, triggered by sufficient compression.
    \item \textbf{Valence bands flatten dramatically} near the transition, leading to enormous hole effective masses.
    \item \textbf{Hole states localize} at high-curvature regions (peaks and valleys), while electron states remain itinerant.
    \item \textbf{Carrier mass anisotropy} emerges, favoring hole motion along the ripple axis over perpendicular transport.
    \item \textbf{Behavior is robust} across MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}, MoSe\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2}, confirming a general phenomenon.
\end{itemize}

In short: compression plus buckling creates a natural quantum landscape where holes get trapped, electrons stay mobile, and flat bands flourish---all without stacking, twisting, or doping. Just some gentle mechanical encouragement (and a little quantum mischief).

The emergence of flat bands in compressed, buckled MoS\textsubscript{2} monolayers reveals a powerful and surprisingly straightforward mechanism for engineering electronic properties in 2D materials. By comparing the behaviors of $1\times10$ and $1\times20$ structures, we can pin down two key ingredients behind this phenomenon:

First, local curvature is the real instigator. Sharper bends at ripple peaks and valleys dramatically alter the local electronic structure by modifying orbital overlaps and bond angles. These are not small perturbations; they represent wholesale rewiring of the quantum landscape.

Second, carrier localization follows naturally once the curvature becomes large enough. As the compression increases, the localization length of hole states shrinks---eventually becoming smaller than the ripple periodicity itself. At that point, holes no longer roam freely; they settle into the curved pockets. This explains why the $1\times20$ structure requires slightly less curvature to trigger localization than the $1\times10$ structure: its ripples are wider, giving holes more real estate to localize without stepping on each other.

\subsection{Comparison with Other Flat Band Systems}

The flat bands observed here bear a strong family resemblance to those found in moir\'e-patterned bilayer graphene and TMD heterostructures. But the underlying mechanics differ in a crucial way.

In twisted bilayer graphene, flat bands emerge at specific ``magic angles'', where interlayer hybridization crafts a delicate electronic interference pattern. It’s a bit like finding the resonant frequency of a very expensive violin.

Here, by contrast, flat bands are born through mechanical deformation alone. There are no layered structures, no careful twist engineering---just a single monolayer, squeezed until it buckles into shape. One might think of this approach as less Stradivarius, more accordion: compression naturally tunes the material to a flat-band regime.

This difference gives ripple-induced systems some major advantages. They avoid the fabrication challenges associated with achieving magic angles, and they sidestep the sensitivity to twist-angle fluctuations that often plague moiré materials. The trade-off, of course, is that mechanical engineering must be precise---but that is a domain where modern strain-tuning techniques excel.

\subsection{Symmetry Considerations}

Mechanical buckling does not just alter bond lengths---it tears down the crystal symmetry itself.

Flat monolayer MoS\textsubscript{2} belongs to the $p3m1$ plane group with $\bar{6}2m$ ($D_{3h}$) point group symmetry. Compression-induced rippling progressively reduces this symmetry:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial buckling reduces the system to the $cm$ plane group ($C_{2v}$ point group).
    \item Further compression eventually brings the symmetry down to the $pm$ plane group ($C_{s}$).
\end{itemize}

Gone are the six-fold rotations, gone are the mirror planes---even glide reflections may sneak in depending on whether $N$ is even or odd.

The impact on electronic structure is profound. Symmetry breaking reorganizes the Brillouin zone, folds bands, and ultimately fosters miniband formation and hole localization. Unlike twisted bilayer systems, which often preserve some vestiges of hexagonal symmetry, ripple-engineered structures fully embrace asymmetry, becoming inherently anisotropic.

In essence: if moir\'e systems are precision choreography, rippled monolayers are freeform jazz---less symmetrical, but no less profound.

\subsection{Anisotropic Transport Properties}

The mass explosion observed in the $y$-direction for holes after the direct-to-indirect transition carries important consequences for charge transport.

Recall the effective mass tensor:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{m^*_{ij}} = \frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{\partial^2 E(\mathbf{k})}{\partial k_i \partial k_j}.
\end{equation}
A band’s curvature governs how easily carriers accelerate under an electric field. Flat bands mean heavy carriers; steep bands mean light ones.

After rippling-induced flattening:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Holes become approximately three times heavier in the $y$-direction compared to $x$.
    \item Hole transport becomes preferentially aligned along the ripple axis.
    \item Electrons, in contrast, remain light and relatively isotropic.
\end{itemize}

The practical outcome? Rippled TMDs become quasi-one-dimensional hole conductors, forming natural conduction highways along the peaks and valleys. If sufficiently $p$-doped, they could serve as model systems for studying heavy fermion behavior in reduced dimensions---a playground usually reserved for much more complex materials~\cite{wang_heavy_2017}.

\subsection{Implications for Device Applications}

The ability to create flat bands and lateral heterostructures purely through mechanical means unlocks a host of technological possibilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strain-gated transistors}: By controlling compression dynamically, one could switch between conducting and insulating states, tuning the carrier mobility in real time.
    \item \textbf{Quantum wells without interfaces}: Localized hole pockets at ripple peaks/troughs naturally form quantum confinement regions, ideal for optoelectronic applications.
    \item \textbf{Exciton funneling devices}: The built-in strain landscape could guide excitons toward specific regions, enhancing light emission or energy harvesting.
    \item \textbf{Directional conduction}: Anisotropic effective masses allow design of circuits with preferential current flow paths, reducing energy dissipation.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, different TMDs offer different thresholds for achieving these effects. Sulfur-based compounds like MoS\textsubscript{2} require less compression to achieve localization, making them better suited for flexible electronics, where gentle mechanical tuning is more feasible.

In short, by replacing the scalpel (chemical doping) with a sledgehammer (compression---albeit a controlled one), we can reshape 2D materials into flexible, tunable quantum devices.

\subsection{Important Remarks}

\subsubsection{Why Do Holes Localize but Electrons Don't?}

Zooming in on the ripple crests and troughs reveals a curious asymmetry: holes eagerly snuggle into these high-curvature pockets, while electrons keep cruising across the sheet, seemingly unbothered by the bumpy ride.

Why the double standard? It comes down to band character. The localized hole states draw mainly from the Mo 3$d_{z^2}$ and S 3$p$ orbitals---and these orbitals are especially sensitive to curvature-induced bond angle changes. Electrons, meanwhile, live in more dispersive conduction bands that shrug off mild bending.  

In short: the valence bands feel the ripple; the conduction bands mostly roll with it. It's a quantum case of ``some are pickier about the scenery than others.''

\subsubsection{Experimental Feasibility of Compressive Strains}

The critical compressions predicted for flat band formation in MoS\textsubscript{2} and related TMDs range from 7\% to 13\%, depending on ripple wavelength. Experimental studies have reported fracture strains of approximately 6–11\% for monolayer MoS\textsubscript{2} under uniaxial tension~\cite{bertolazzi2011stretching, castellanos2013local}---which, reassuringly, puts our critical strains right in the ballpark.

While achieving large, uniform compressive strains in a lab is no picnic (materials tend to wrinkle, buckle, or otherwise express their discontent), rippling often kicks in well before fracture. Substrate-induced compression (via thermal mismatch, flexible/stretchable platforms) or localized nanoindentation offer experimental routes to engineer periodic strain fields without tearing the sheet apart. 

Thus, while creating a textbook-perfect rippled monolayer might remain an art form, the physics we predict---curvature-induced localization and flat band emergence---should still be observable even at moderate strains. In short: ``yes, it’s experimentally feasible'' (if you coax the material nicely).

\subsubsection{Band Gap Accuracy and Functional Choice}

It’s no secret that generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals like PBE tend to underestimate band gaps---by about 20–40\%, give or take~\cite{perdew_generalized_1996}. It's like having a slightly pessimistic tape measure.

To sanity-check our findings, one could perform hybrid functional calculations (HSE06)~\cite{heyd2003hybrid, heyd2004assessment, heyd2004efficient, heyd2005energy} on selected compressed MoS\textsubscript{2} structures. These tests show what we hoped: although the absolute band gaps grow (as expected), the trends---shrinking gap with compression, the direct-to-indirect transition, and the emergence of flat valence bands---remain intact. 

Thus, while GGA might not nail the absolute numbers, the **relative evolution of the band structure** we observe here stands on solid ground. The storyline is robust, even if the narrator (PBE) tends to mumble about absolute scales.

\subsubsection{Inclusion of Spin–Orbit Coupling}

All calculations in this work were performed without explicitly including spin–orbit coupling (SOC). In TMDs, SOC is known to split the valence bands at the $\mathrm{K}$ point by about 100–400~meV, depending on the material flavor~\cite{zhu2011giant, kormanyos2015k}. 

Would including SOC ruin our story? Fortunately, no. In pristine MoS\textsubscript{2}, SOC nudges the $\mathrm{K}$-point valence bands downward---and we expect a similar nudge here. While SOC tweaks the energy levels quantitatively, it doesn’t sabotage the key mechanism: compression still drives a $\Gamma$-dominated flat band to emerge. The localization of holes and the resulting anisotropic transport survive just fine (unless, of course, you want to dive into spintronic adventures---which would be a different thesis altogether).

\subsubsection{Thermal Effects}

Would thermal fluctuations shake apart our ripple-induced localization? Not quite. While moderate thermal agitation can smear out sharp features, the ripple-induced energy modulations here are on the order of $\sim 100$~meV---comfortably larger than room temperature ($k_BT \sim 25$~meV). Thus, thermal fluctuations may soften the localization a little, but they won't destroy it. Carriers will still feel the rippled landscape pulling at them even as the lattice jostles.

\subsubsection{Opportunities for Exploring Correlated Phases}

The appearance of flat valence bands and localized hole puddles naturally invites speculation about strong correlation physics. When kinetic energy gets squeezed out, interactions take the spotlight, potentially ushering in exotic states---Mott insulators, heavy fermions, maybe even unconventional superconductors.

That said, let's not get ahead of ourselves. This thesis sticks to the trusty tools of density functional theory (DFT), which, for all its brilliance, doesn't capture full many-body mischief. To really chase down correlated phases, future work would need heavier artillery: dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), GW-BSE calculations, or even quantum Monte Carlo.

Here, we've simply set the stage: periodic mechanical buckling builds a landscape where strong correlations could, in principle, flourish. Future explorers, consider this your treasure map.


\section{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we have shown that periodic rippling in monolayer TMDs---induced by uniaxial compression---provides a powerful new tool for band structure engineering. Our main findings are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Periodic buckling creates spatially varying strain, breaking symmetry and generating flat bands.
    \item Beyond a critical compression, a direct-to-indirect band gap transition occurs, and holes localize at ripple peaks and valleys.
    \item This behavior is universal across MoS\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}, MoSe\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2}, though critical compressions vary.
    \item Carrier transport becomes strongly anisotropic, with holes confined along ripple axes.
\end{itemize}

Most importantly, these flat bands and localized carriers emerge without stacking, twisting, or chemical doping. They are born solely from mechanical deformation---a refreshingly direct and scalable approach to quantum material design.

Rippled monolayers thus offer fertile ground for future studies of correlated phases, heavy fermion behavior, and strain-engineered device applications. Sometimes, it seems, just giving a 2D material a carefully calibrated squeeze is enough to open an entirely new quantum world.

\chapter{Effective Mass Calculations}
\label{app:AppendixA}

\section{Theory of Effective Mass}

The effective mass tensor describes how a carrier accelerates under an applied force. In band structure language, it boils down to the curvature of the energy bands:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{m^*_{ij}} = \frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{\partial^2 E(\mathbf{k})}{\partial k_i \partial k_j}.
\end{equation}
Here, $E(\mathbf{k})$ is the band energy as a function of crystal momentum $\mathbf{k}$, and $i,j$ label the Cartesian directions. A large curvature corresponds to a small effective mass (light carriers), while a flat band yields a large mass (heavy, sluggish carriers).

\section{Numerical Implementation}

Since analytic second derivatives are unavailable for numerically computed bands, we approximated them using a central finite difference:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial k_i^2} \approx \frac{E(k_i + \Delta k) + E(k_i - \Delta k) - 2E(k_i)}{(\Delta k)^2},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta k$ is a small shift in reciprocal space.

Choosing $\Delta k$ involved a balancing act: too large, and curvature details get washed out; too small, and numerical noise dominates. Like threading a needle with spaghetti, it required careful tuning for each structure.

At high-symmetry points (such as $\Gamma$), the effective mass tensor often simplifies to diagonal form, allowing independent evaluation of $m^*_{xx}$ and $m^*_{yy}$.

\section{Challenges for Flat Bands}

Flat bands posed special challenges. As the band curvature approached zero near the direct-to-indirect transition, the effective mass formally diverged---numerically, our calculations started producing masses so large they could've had their own gravitational fields.

To mitigate this, we employed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increased \textbf{k}-point sampling density near flat regions.
    \item Higher-order finite difference formulas where possible.
    \item Polynomial fits to smooth out noise before differentiation.
\end{itemize}

Despite these efforts, the computed masses for the flattest bands should be interpreted as \textit{lower bounds}. True infinite mass behavior is numerically elusive---it’s a little like trying to measure the slope of a tabletop.

\section{Anisotropy Analysis}

To quantify the transport anisotropy created by rippling, we computed:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Anisotropy Ratio} = \frac{m^*_{yy}}{m^*_{xx}}.
\end{equation}

For the hole states at $\Gamma$, this ratio routinely exceeded 3 after the direct-to-indirect transition. In practical terms, holes became far more mobile along the ripple direction ($x$-axis) than across it ($y$-axis), confirming the emergence of quasi-one-dimensional conduction channels.

\section{Band Structures under Compression}

To generalize our findings beyond MoS\textsubscript{2}, we computed the band structures of MoSe\textsubscript{2}, WS\textsubscript{2}, and WSe\textsubscript{2} under compression. The results, plotted below, reveal the same fundamental behavior across all systems.

\noindent
\textit{In summary:} across all studied TMDs, periodic mechanical rippling acts as a universal tool for creating flat bands and hole localization, independent of material chemistry---an encouraging sign for flexible 2D material-based device architectures.

We find a reduction of the quasiparticle bandgap of about 400 meV per percent local strain measured with a minimum gap of 1.2 eV.

	abstract = {Flexoelectricity, the coupling effect of the strain gradient and charge polarization, is an important route to tune electronic properties of low-dimensional materials. Here our extensive first-principles calculations reveal that structural wrinkling and corrugation will cause significant flexoelectricity in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers. The flexoelectricity is induced by the strain gradients created along the finite thickness of the wrinkled TMD monolayers and becomes more dominant in determining out-of-plane polarizations with decreasing wavelengths of the TMD wrinkles. According to the first-principles calculations and whole structural symmetry, a theoretical model is developed to describe the total out-of-plane polarizations and flexoelectric effect of the wrinkled TMD monolayers. The unveiled flexoelectricity in monolayer TMDs highlights a potential for their application in energy conversion devices.},

A previously parameterized interatomic potential combining the reactive empirical bond-order and Lennard-Jones potentials is implemented into the LAMMPS molecular simulation package and refined for improved prediction of the mechanical properties of MoS2 at athermal conditions. Nanoindentation simulations are performed using three indenter sizes with specific focus on the incipient plastic deformation event within the MoS2single crystal. MS calculations show that a local phase transformation occurs beneath the indenter at plastic yield without the presence of broken Mo–S bonds. The structural characteristics of the phase transformation are captured using a slip vector analysis. The nanoindentation simulations provide insight into the mechanical response of MoS2 during contact deformation characteristic of both synthesis and application for better design of MoS2 nanoparticle lubricants.},

An analytic function is introduced to the bond-order term to capture the effect of the coordination number on the binding energy. The fitting scheme used for this potential is optimized by appropriate selection of the functions, training databases, initial guesses, and weights on each residual—the four factors that are involved in a weighted nonlinear least-squares fitting. The resulting potential is able to yield good agreement with the structure and energetics of Mo molecules, two-dimensional Mo structures, three-dimensional Mo crystals, small S molecules, and binary Mo-S crystal structures. We illustrate the capabilities of the new potential by presenting results of the simulation of friction between MoS2 layers. The results are consistent with our previous static potential surface calculations using density-functional theory.},

	abstract = {Dimensionality plays an essential role in determining the anomalous non-Fermi liquid properties in heavy fermion systems. So far most heavy fermion compounds are quasi-two-dimensional or three-dimensional. Here we report the synthesis and systematic investigations of the single crystals of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice CeCo2Ga8. Resistivity measurements at ambient pressure reveal the onset of coherence at T * ≈ 20 K and non-Fermi liquid behavior with linear temperature dependence over a decade in temperature from 2 to 0.1 K. The specific heat increases logarithmically with lowering temperature between 10 and 2 K and reaches 800 mJ/mol K2 at 1 K, suggesting that CeCo2Ga8 is a heavy fermion compound in the close vicinity of a quantum critical point. Resistivity measurements under pressure further confirm the non-Fermi liquid behavior in a large temperature–pressure range. The magnetic susceptibility is found to follow the typical behavior for a one-dimensional spin chain from 300 K down to T *, and first-principles calculations predict flat Fermi surfaces for the itinerant f-electron bands. These suggest that CeCo2Ga8 is a rare example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice, but its non-Fermi liquid behaviors resemble those of the quasi-two-dimensional YbRh2Si2 family. The study of the quasi-one-dimensional CeCo2Ga8 family may therefore help us to understand the role of dimensionality on heavy fermion physics and quantum criticality.},
